Segmentation remains one of the main problems of image analysis. It can be handled in many applications as a classification problem. For instance, let $y_i$ denote the value (or gray level) of the $i$th pixel in the image $A$. Statistically speaking, $y_i$ is drawn from a random variable $Y$ , i.e. $y_i âˆ¼ Y$ , which represents the gray level distribution in $A$. A segmentation process could then be to find out the class $c_k$ of pixel $i$ according to $Y$ (with $k = 1...N$ classes).
